# Disboard
Disboard is a collaborative whiteboard for students to share a platform and engage in group work. Instructors can create assignment questions and view the submissions of the students after the work has been completed. 

# **Features**
- Students: Collaborate with students on a shared whiteboard using a touch-enabled device.
  - Create/join discussion rooms on demand to work on a group assignment during class.
  - Use a stylus or your finger to draw free-form responses to a series of questions.
  - Express creativity using different colored pen options.
- Instructors: Create assignments, share with students, and view their whiteboard responses.
  - Create unique assignments composed of text-based questions.
  - Deploy to students by provided an assignment ID.
  - View all responses in an instructor view that can be shared with others.
  
# **Future Ideas**
- **User authentication** : Users will soon be able to create accounts to store their assignments and submissions under their name. This also paves the way for room chat (see below)
- **LaTeX** support: Instructors will be able to create math questions using the popular LaTeX syntax, allowing students to answer math questions in free-form drawing
- **Chat** : Students will be able to discuss their whiteboard collaboration via an in-room text chat
- **Miscellaneous** : Multi-color support is on the horizon! Then we can all be Bob Ross
